Hi Welcome to my Github! 
Currently it is an unsorted collection of code I developed for my various classes. 
The topics include linear programming, machine learning, and neural networks! 

P.S. - ask me about my current projects in predicting employee turnover using neural networks as well as using conic programming for assortment optimization problems!
